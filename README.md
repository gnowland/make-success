# make-success
A makefile for scaffolding, pushing, pulling, syncing, databases and files local &amp; remote.

Currently in use on a [Dokku](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/)-powered ([Docker](https://docker.com)-ized [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) installation.

Minor modifications would be required to generalize it for use in any environment.

## Requirements

- A fresh installation of [Ubuntu 18.04 x64](https://www.ubuntu.com/download)
- The FQDN set
  - Run `sudo hostname -f` to check if the system has an FQDN set
- At least 1GB of system memory
- A domain name pointed at the host's IP (optional)

## Use

### Make

Commands sourced from `Makefile`.

`make build` clones repo from https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress using variables within `.env` and configuration files within `config` and deploys it to a ([Docker](https://docker.com) container running [heroku-buildpack-php](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-php) using the a [gliderlabs/herokuish](https://github.com/gliderlabs/herokuish) build orchestration on `git push dokku master`.

> \*Before `make push ...`, `make pull ...`, `make theme_build ...`, or `vscode-ext.sync-rsync` will work you must first modify the host `visudo` settings to allow unattended operations:

> üåç The following commands should be run on the server

```shell
which rsync # take note of the result!
sudo visudo
```

And add the following to the bottom of the file (lower instructions take precedence):

```shell
[<username>] ALL=NOPASSWD:[<path returned from which rsync>]
```

IMPORTANT TARGET PATH INFORMATION!
- Source
  - When using "/" at the end of source path, rsync will copy the *content* of the source folder to the destination, but not the folder itself.
  - When omitting "/" from the end of source path, rsync will copy *the folder and its content* to the destination.
- Destination
  - When using "/" at the end of the destination path, rsync will place the data *inside the last destination folder*.
  - When omitting "/" from the end of the destination path, rsync will *create a folder with the name of the last destination* and paste the data inside that folder.

## Upgrading WordPress

To upgrade to a later version of WordPress just change the version number in the `.env` file and run `make build` again!

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: A 'traditional' upgrade performed using the WordPress UI-based upgrade process will not survive a server app restart (due to the ephemeral nature of the underlying docker-based filesystem) and thus should not be attempted if you want to persist the upgrade.
